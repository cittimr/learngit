Over a river there was a quite narrow bridge. 
There were two goats. 
Over a river there was a very narrow bridge. 
Just at the middle of the bride he met another goat.
One day a goat was crossing this bridge.  
There was no room for them to pass. 
Go back, said one goat to the other, "There is no room for both of us".  John said no there not
"Why should I go back?" said the other goat. "Better you must go back." 
“You must go back", said the first goat, "because I am stronger than you." 
"You are stronger than I", said the second goat. 
"We will see about that", said the first goat and he put down his horns to fight. 
"Stop!" said the second oat. 
This line shouldnt be here.
“If we fight, we shall both fail into the river and be drowned and instead I have a plane. I shall lie down and you may walk over me." 
Then the wise one laid down on the bridge and the other goat walked highly over him. 
So they crossed the bridge comfortably and went on their ways.
